# AngularAnimation

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.4.

## Description
Display a simple box that will move to the position of mouse click, I move the center of the box actually. Allow user to adjust the current animation speed, by default, I let it as 1000ms.

This project is very simple, I don't apply Angular Animation but I have plans to do it. I need to recalculate the translation from the box to mouse position.
